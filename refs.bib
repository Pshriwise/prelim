abstract={Ray tracing requires testing of many rays to determine intersections with objects. A way of reducing the computation is to organize objects into hierarchical data structures. We examine two heuristics for space subdivisions using bintrees, one based on the intuition that surface area is a good estimate of intersection probability, one based on the fact that the optimal splitting plane lies between the spatial median and the object median planes of a volume. Traversal algorithms using cross links between nodes are presented as generalizations of ropes in octrees. Simulations of the surface area heuristic and the cross link scheme are presented. These results generalize to other hierarchical data structures.},

	abstract = {A set of improved geometric capabilities are developed for the Direct Accelerated Geometry for Monte Carlo (DAGMC) library to increase its ease of use and accuracy. The improvements are watertight faceting, robust particle tracking, automatic creation of nonsolid space, and overlap tolerance. Before being sealed, adjacent faceted surfaces do not have the same discretization along shared curves. Sealing together surfaces to create a watertight faceting prevents leakage of particles between surfaces. The tracking algorithm is made robust by ensuring numerical consistency and avoiding geometric tolerances. Monte Carlo simulation requires all space to be defined, whether it be vacuum, air, coolant, or a solid material. The implicit creation of nonsolid space reduces human effort otherwise required to explicitly create nonsolid space in a CAD program. CAD models often contain small gaps and overlaps between adjacent volumes due to imprecise modeling, file translation, or intentional deformation. Although gaps are filled by the implicit creation of nonsolid space, overlaps cause geometric queries to become unreliable. The particle tracking algorithm and point inclusion test are modified to tolerate small overlaps of adjacent volumes. Overlap-tolerant particle tracking eliminates manual repair of CAD models and enables analysis of meshed finite element models undergoing structural deformation. These improvements are implemented in a coupling of DAGMC with the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code, known as DAG-MCNP. The elimination of both manual CAD repair and lost particles are demonstrated with CAD models used in production calculations.},

It is shown that it is not necessary for a minimum volume box to have any sides flush with a face of the convex hull of the set of points, which makes a naive search problematic. Nevertheless, it is proven that at least two adjacent box sides are flush with edges of the hull, and this characterization enables anO(n3) algorithm to find all minimal boxes for a set ofn points.",

 abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},
