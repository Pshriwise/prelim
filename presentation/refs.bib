abstract={Ray tracing requires testing of many rays to determine intersections with objects. A way of reducing the computation is to organize objects into hierarchical data structures. We examine two heuristics for space subdivisions using bintrees, one based on the intuition that surface area is a good estimate of intersection probability, one based on the fact that the optimal splitting plane lies between the spatial median and the object median planes of a volume. Traversal algorithms using cross links between nodes are presented as generalizations of ropes in octrees. Simulations of the surface area heuristic and the cross link scheme are presented. These results generalize to other hierarchical data structures.},

abstract = "Abstract \{MCNP6\} can be described as the merger of \{MCNP5\} and \{MCNPX\} capabilities, but it is much more than the sum of these two computer codes. \{MCNP6\} is the result of six years of effort by the \{MCNP5\} and \{MCNPX\} code development teams. These groups of people, residing in Los Alamos National Laboratoryâ€™s X Computational Physics Division, Monte Carlo Codes Group (XCP-3) and Nuclear Engineering and Nonproliferation Division, Radiation Transport Modeling Team (NEN-5) respectively, have combined their code development efforts to produce the next evolution of MCNP. While maintenance and major bug fixes will continue for \{MCNP5\} 1.60 and \{MCNPX\} 2.7.0 for upcoming years, new code development capabilities only will be developed and released in MCNP6. In fact, the initial release of \{MCNP6\} contains numerous new features not previously found in either code. These new features are summarized in this document. Packaged with \{MCNP6\} is also the new production release of the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data files usable by MCNP. The high quality of the overall merged code, usefulness of these new features, along with the desire in the user community to start using the merged code, have led us to make the first \{MCNP6\} production release: \{MCNP6\} version 1. High confidence in the \{MCNP6\} code is based on its performance with the verification and validation test suites, comparisons to its predecessor codes, our automated nightly software debugger tests, the underlying high quality nuclear and atomic databases, and significant testing by many beta testers.
